        <h6>THE EXCHANGE BY ALTHEA THURSTON</h6>
        <P>RICH CITIZEN. [_Showing vexation._] No, no, _no_. Too many old women
            that want to gossip. I tell you, I want to get away from women. Haven't
            you something peaceful and quiet; something that would take me out in
            the quiet of the early morning, when the birds are singing?
            <br>
            JUDGE. [_Closing ledger with a bang, and rising._] Well, you're too
            particular, and I have not time to bother with you. I bid you good
            after----
            <br>
            IMP. [_Slides from his desk, runs to railing, and speaks suavely._]
            Excuse me, Judge, but maybe the gentleman would like the vocation of
            milkman. That is early-morning work. And, you remember, a milkman left
            his job here when he took that old, worn-out senator's position.
            <br>
            JUDGE. [_Sharply, to_ RICH CITIZEN.] Well, how about it? Does a
            milkman's vocation suit you? It's early-morning hours, fresh air, and no
            people about.
            <br>
            RICH CITIZEN. [_Musingly._] Well, the very simplicity and quietness of
            it is its charm. It rather appeals to me. [_He ponders a moment._] Yes,
            by Jove, I'll take it.
            <br>
            JUDGE. [_Sternly._] Hold up your right hand. "Do you solemnly swear to
            accept, for better or for worse, the vocation of milkman as your lot in
            life, so help you God?"
            <br>
            RICH CITIZEN. I do.
            <br>
            JUDGE. [_To_ IMP.] Show this gentleman to the changing-room.
            <br>
            IMP. [_While escorting him to the curtained door._] Yes, sir, you will
            lead the simple life. Fresh air, fresh milk, no people, just cows--and
            they can't talk. [_Holding aside the curtains._] Third booth, sir.
            <br>
            RICH CITIZEN. [_Musingly._] The simple life--peace and quietness.
            <br>
                 [_Exit._
            <br>
            JUDGE. [I_n disgust._] It's no use, Imp. They all cling to their vices,
            but they are very keen to change some little cross or condition that
            vexes them--or think vexes them.
            <br>
            IMP. It's strange that people always want something different from what
            they have.
            
                 [IMP _opens a drawer in his desk and takes out a bottle, evidently
                 filled with tablets, which he holds up, shaking it and chuckling.
                 He hunts in the drawer again, and this time brings forth a huge
                 ear-trumpet, which he chucklingly places an his table beside the
                 bottle of tablets._
                 <br>
            FORMER POOR MAN. What is that?</P>
