        <h6>THE EXCHANGE BY ALTHEA THURSTON</h6>
        <P>RICH CITIZEN. [_Showing vexation._] No, no, _no_. Too many old women
            that want to gossip. I tell you, I want to get away from women. Haven't
            you something peaceful and quiet; something that would take me out in
            the quiet of the early morning, when the birds are singing?
            
            JUDGE. [_Closing ledger with a bang, and rising._] Well, you're too
            particular, and I have not time to bother with you. I bid you good
            after----
            
            IMP. [_Slides from his desk, runs to railing, and speaks suavely._]
            Excuse me, Judge, but maybe the gentleman would like the vocation of
            milkman. That is early-morning work. And, you remember, a milkman left
            his job here when he took that old, worn-out senator's position.
            
            JUDGE. [_Sharply, to_ RICH CITIZEN.] Well, how about it? Does a
            milkman's vocation suit you? It's early-morning hours, fresh air, and no
            people about.
            
            RICH CITIZEN. [_Musingly._] Well, the very simplicity and quietness of
            it is its charm. It rather appeals to me. [_He ponders a moment._] Yes,
            by Jove, I'll take it.
            
            JUDGE. [_Sternly._] Hold up your right hand. "Do you solemnly swear to
            accept, for better or for worse, the vocation of milkman as your lot in
            life, so help you God?"
            
            RICH CITIZEN. I do.
            
            JUDGE. [_To_ IMP.] Show this gentleman to the changing-room.
            
            IMP. [_While escorting him to the curtained door._] Yes, sir, you will
            lead the simple life. Fresh air, fresh milk, no people, just cows--and
            they can't talk. [_Holding aside the curtains._] Third booth, sir.
            
            RICH CITIZEN. [_Musingly._] The simple life--peace and quietness.
            
                 [_Exit._
            
            JUDGE. [I_n disgust._] It's no use, Imp. They all cling to their vices,
            but they are very keen to change some little cross or condition that
            vexes them--or think vexes them.
            
            IMP. It's strange that people always want something different from what
            they have.
            
                 [IMP _opens a drawer in his desk and takes out a bottle, evidently
                 filled with tablets, which he holds up, shaking it and chuckling.
                 He hunts in the drawer again, and this time brings forth a huge
                 ear-trumpet, which he chucklingly places an his table beside the
                 bottle of tablets._
            
            JUDGE. Don't let any more in, Imp. I can't stand another one to-day. I
            am going to write a letter and then go home.
            
            IMP. All right, sir.
            
            JUDGE. I am feeling very tired; what I really need is a vacation. A
            sea-trip would put me right. By the way, Imp, where is that
            transatlantic folder that I told you to get?
            
                 [IMP _picks up the folder from his desk and takes it to the_ JUDGE,
                 _who studies it attentively_. IMP _returns to his own desk, where
                 he again looks in a drawer and brings forth a menu card, which he
                 glances over, grinning mischievously_.
            
                 [_The former_ POOR MAN _re-enters from the changing-room. He is
                 well dressed, and taking a well-filled wallet from his pocket, he
                 looks at it gloatingly. However, from time to time, a shade of
                 annoyance passes over his face, and he puts his hand to the pit of
                 his stomach._ IMP _runs to meet him, and hands him the menu that he
                 has been reading_.
            
            IMP. Here's a menu from the Gargoyle. Say, you sure do look swell!
            [_Looking him over admiringly._
            
            FORMER POOR MAN. [_Grinning happily._] Some class to me now, eh!
            [_Looking at menu._] And you watch me pick out a real dinner. [_Sits
            down at left front._] First, I'll have a cocktail, then--let's see--I'll
            have--another cocktail. Next, oysters, and [_he frowns and presses his
            hand to the pit of his stomach, keeping up a massaging
            motion_]--green-turtle soup, sand dabs--chicken breasts--
            
                 [_They become absorbed over the menu._
            
                 [_The_ VAIN WOMAN _re-enters from the changing-room. She now has a
                 smooth face, and she is looking at herself in a hand-glass,
                 smiling and touching her face delightedly, She walks over to the
                 railing, and leans over it to the_ JUDGE. _He looks up
                 questioningly._
            
            VAIN WOMAN. [_Smiling._] Oh, I am so happy again. Am I not beautiful?
            
            JUDGE. [_Pityingly._] You are a vain, foolish woman.
            
                 [_Since she is deaf, she does not hear his words, but thinks he is
                 complimenting her. She smiles at him coyly._
            
            VAIN WOMAN. Ah, Judge, you too are susceptible to my charms.
            
                 [_The_ JUDGE, _in great exasperation, puts away his papers, thrusts
                 the transatlantic folder in his pocket, hastily closes his desk,
                 and hurries to the hat-rack, puts on his overcoat, slips his
                 skull-cap into his pocket and puts on his soft black hat. Then,
                 with a shrug of his shoulders and a wave of his hand indicative of
                 disgust, he slips quietly out._
            
                 [_The_ VAIN WOMAN _saunters past the_ FORMER POOR MAN, _stops near
                 him, posing, and begins to put on her gloves. He looks at her
                 admiringly, then, getting to his feet, makes an elaborate but
                 awkward bow._
            
            FORMER POOR MAN. Excuse me, lady, but I've had a big piece of luck
            to-day, and I want to celebrate, so I am having a big dinner. Won't you
            join me and help me have a good time?
            
            VAIN WOMAN. [_Looking at him blankly, and trying to fathom what he has
            said._] Oh--why, what did you say?
            
            FORMER POOR MAN. [_Hesitating, and a bit surprised._] Why--er--I said
            that I had a big piece of luck to-day, and I am going to celebrate. I am
            having a fine dinner, and I just asked if--if--you wouldn't have dinner
            with me.
            
            VAIN WOMAN. [_Still looking blank and a little confused, then smiling
            archly and acting as though she had been hearing compliments, she speaks
            affectedly._] Really, do you think so? [_Looking down and smoothing her
            dress._] But, then, every one tells me that I am.
            
            FORMER POOR MAN. [_Puzzled, turns to_ IMP _for help_.] Just what is her
            trouble, Nut?
            
            IMP. [_Secretly gleeful._] She is stone-deaf. You had better write it.
            
            FORMER POOR MAN. Never! No deaf ones for me.
            
                 [_Turns away and consults menu again._ VAIN WOMAN _poses and
                 frequently looks in hand-glass to reassure herself_.
            
                 [FORMER RICH CITIZEN _re-enters from the changing-room. He is
                 dressed in shabby overalls, jumper, and an old hat. He has a pipe
                 in his mouth. He walks arrogantly over to the_ FORMER POOR MAN _and
                 addresses him_.
            
            FORMER RICH CITIZEN. Give me a light.
            
            FORMER POOR MAN. [_Trying to live up to his fine clothes and wallet full
            of money, looks the_ FORMER RICH CITIZEN _over snubbingly_.] Say, who do
            you think you are? You light out, see?
            
            FORMER RICH CITIZEN. [_Very much surprised, stands nonplussed a
            moment._] Well, upon my word, I--I----
            
                 [_He stops short in his speech, walks haughtily over to the
                 railing, where he stands glowering at the_ FORMER POOR MAN. _The_
                 FORMER POOR MAN _starts for the street door, but_ IMP _runs after
                 him, waving the bottle of tablets_.
            
            IMP. I'll sell you these for two bits.
            
            FORMER POOR MAN. What is that?</P>
