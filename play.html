        <h6>THE EXCHANGE BY ALTHEA THURSTON</h6>
        <h6>RICH CITIZEN.</h6> <p>[_Showing vexation._] </p>
        <p>No, no, _no_. Too many old women
            that want to gossip. I tell you, I want to get away from women. Haven't
            you something peaceful and quiet; something that would take me out in
            the quiet of the early morning, when the birds are singing?
            </P>
        <h6>JUDGE.</h6><p>[_Closing ledger with a bang, and rising._]</p> <p>Well, you're too
                particular, and I have not time to bother with you. I bid you good
                after----</p>
        <h6>IMP. </h6><p>[_Slides from his desk, runs to railing, and speaks suavely._]</p>
            <p>Excuse me, Judge, but maybe the gentleman would like the vocation of
            milkman. That is early-morning work. And, you remember, a milkman left
            his job here when he took that old, worn-out senator's position.</p>
        <h6>JUDGE. </h6><p>[_Sharply, to_ RICH CITIZEN.]</p><p> Well, how about it? Does a
                milkman's vocation suit you? It's early-morning hours, fresh air, and no
                people about.</p>
        <h6>RICH CITIZEN.</h6> <p>[_Musingly._]</p><p> Well, the very simplicity and quietness of
            it is its charm. It rather appeals to me. </p><p>[_He ponders a moment._] </p><p>Yes,
            by Jove, I'll take it.</p>
        <h6>JUDGE.</h6><p>[_Sternly._]</p><p>Hold up your right hand. "Do you solemnly swear to
                accept, for better or for worse, the vocation of milkman as your lot in
                life, so help you God?"</p>
        <h6>RICH CITIZEN.</h6><p> I do.</p>
        <h6>JUDGE.</h6> <p>[_To_ IMP.]</p><p> Show this gentleman to the changing-room.</p>
        <h6>IMP.</h6> <p>[_While escorting him to the curtained door._]</p><p> Yes, sir, you will
            lead the simple life. Fresh air, fresh milk, no people, just cows--and
            they can't talk.</p> <p>[_Holding aside the curtains._] </p><p>Third booth, sir.</p>
            
        <p>[_He stops short in his speech, walks haughtily over to the
            railing, where he stands glowering at the_ FORMER POOR MAN. _The_
            FORMER POOR MAN _starts for the street door, but_ IMP _runs after
            him, waving the bottle of tablets_.</p>

        <p>IMP. I'll sell you these for two bits.</p>
        <p><h6>FORMER POOR MAN.</h6> What is that?</P>
